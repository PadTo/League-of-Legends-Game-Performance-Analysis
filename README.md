# 🧩 League of Legends Data Pipeline

> **Status**: In Development  
> **Purpose**: Automated, configurable data pipeline for fetching, filtering, and storing *League of Legends* match data using Riot's official API.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains a modular, rate-limited, and well-logged data pipeline built around the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/). It automates the process of:

- Retrieving ranked match data across tiers and roles
- Filtering relevant events and timelines
- Storing structured results in a local SQLite database
- Preparing clean datasets for statistical analysis and machine learning

## ⚙️ Features

### 🔗 Riot API Interface (`riot_api.py`)
- Interacts with Riot’s Match-V5, Summoner-V4, and Spectator-V4 endpoints
- Fetches player PUUIDs, match histories, and timelines
- Implements robust error handling and rate limit compliance

### 🧠 Pipeline Controller (`pipeline_workflow.py`)
- End-to-end orchestration of:
  - Player and match data retrieval
  - Timeline extraction
  - Filter application and database storage
- Enables batch collection and control over sample size and rank tier

### 🧼 JSON Filtering Module (`processing/response_filters.py`)
- Extracts:
  - Key game events (kills, dragons, barons, towers)
  - Player stats and item builds
  - Timeline information for positional or time-based analyses

### 🧱 Database Integration (`riot_data_database.db`)
- Lightweight SQLite database setup
- Stores structured data across:
  - Match metadata
  - Participant performance
  - Event sequences and timelines

### 🪵 Logging System (`logs/riot_data.log`)
- Tracks request success/failure and error messages
- Useful for debugging long pipeline runs
- Controlled via `configs/logging_config.yaml`
