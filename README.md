# League of Legends Statistical Analysis Project (IN PROGRESS)


## Project Overview
This project analyzes *League of Legends* gameplay data to identify patterns and strategies that differentiate high-Elo players from casual players

## Terminology

### Game-Specific Terms
- **Elo Rating**: A ranking system used to determine player skill level
- **MOBA**: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, a strategy-based team game genre
- **Creep Score**: The number of minions a player has killed for gold
- **Recall Timers**: The cooldown time for returning to base
- **Wave Management**: The strategy of controlling minion waves for advantage
- **Pathing/Routes**: The movement strategy of players, especially junglers
- **Jungle Monsters**: Neutral creatures in the jungle that provide experience and buffs
- **Nexus**: The core structure that must be destroyed to win the game
- **Turrets**: Defensive structures that attack enemies
- **Champion**: A playable character with unique abilities
- **In-Game Objectives**: Key map goals like Dragon, Baron, and Towers
- **Vision Score**: A metric showing vision control through wards and reveals
- **Rank**: The tiered ranking system from Iron to Challenger
- **Early Game**: The first phase of a match, focusing on laning and farming
- **Mid Game**: The transition phase where objectives become key
- **Late Game**: The final phase where team fights and strategy decide the game

### Technical Terms
- **Significance Level**: The probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis in stats
- **Linear Regression**: A statistical method for modeling relationships between variables
- **Hypothesis Testing**: A statistical process to determine the validity of an assumption
- **API**: Application Programming Interface, used for data retrieval
- **Data Pipeline**: A system for collecting, processing, and analyzing data

## Project Details

### 1. Objective Definitions
To understand the performance patterns that differentiate high-level play from average gameplay through statistical analysis of in-game mechanics and strategies.

#### 1.1 Research Goals
- **Creep Score and Recall Timers**
  - Compare patterns between High-Elo vs Low-Elo players
- **Effective Jungle Routes (High-Elo Only)**
  - Identify Most Popular Champions
  - Determine Highest Win-Rate Champions and their patterns
- **High Elo Pathing vs Low Elo Pathing**
  - Document general pathing patterns across Early, Mid, and Late Game
  - Analyze pathing patterns when objectives are available (Dragon, Baron, Jungle Monsters)
- **Player Movement Analysis**
  - Track Early, Mid, and Late Game player movement based on lane positions

#### 1.2 Success Metrics
*To be defined: Specific metrics that will indicate successful analysis outcomes*

#### 1.3 Data Requirements
- **Player Rank Ranges for Analysis:**
  - High Elo: Master to Challenger
  - Mid-Elo: Diamond
  - Low-Elo: Iron to Bronze
- **Sample Size Requirements:**
  *To be determined: Minimum number of games needed for statistically significant analysis*

#### 1.4 Technical Scope
*To be defined: Technical boundaries and limitations of the project*

### 2. Project Phases
1. **API Configuration**
   - Setting up API connections
2. **Setting up the Database and Retrieving Data (CURRENT STAGE)**
   - Creating SQL database and importing initial data using API calls
3. **Data Processing & Cleaning**
   - Transforming, Normalizing and preparing data for analysis
4. **Analysis Development**
   - Creating statistical models and running analyses
5. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identifying significant patterns and correlations
6. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Creating visual representations and actionable insights
